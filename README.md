Project involved analysis and prediction of loan repayment using a combination of financial and non-financial factors for SBA-guaranteed loans. Various models such as logistic regression, random forest, and Tab Net were implemented.

Small businesses are a vital part of the American economy, and the US Small Business Administration (SBA) plays a crucial role in supporting these businesses through its loan programs. For lenders and financial institutions, being able to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid can help them manage their risk and make more informed lending decisions. This project aims to analyze which features affect the performance of loans and predict whether a loan is likely to be repaid or defaulted. A combination of financial and non-financial factors are used to predict the success of SBA-guaranteed loans and various models such as logistic regression, random forest and Tab Net are implemented. The performance of each model is evaluated using a data set of past loan applications. On comparing the accuracy of the models, it is observed that the best performing algorithm for the data set is random forest with an F1 score of 0.95.
